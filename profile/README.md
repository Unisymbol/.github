Unisymbol and its subsidiary [EmojiDAO](https://github.com/TheEmojiDAO) came from the urgency of complementing and protesting (not replacing) Unicode and its ice-aged board/policies; our organization, with warm and open arms, supports the wholesome [More Pride Emojis](https://moreprideemojis.com/flags/bisexual.html) movement to better represent human stuff (rather than machine stuff as if we were in the distopic reality of movies like The Terminator).
